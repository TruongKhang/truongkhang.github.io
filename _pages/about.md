Hello, my name is Khang Truong-Giang. I am currently a PhD student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). My advisor is Prof. [Sungho Jo](http://nmail.kaist.ac.kr/wordpress/index.php/professor-jo-sungho/). Before joining KAIST, I received my bachelor degree at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam. During this time, I did some projects related to topic modeling, machine learning.

**Research interests:** Currently, I focus on some topics in 3D vision such as 3D reconstruction, multi-view stereo, or camera pose estimation. My goal is to produce algorithms which can achieve high performance while only using limited GPU resources. I wrote several programs on [Github](https://github.com/TruongKhang).
