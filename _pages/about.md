Hello, my name is Khang Truong Giang, a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sungho Jo](http://nmail.kaist.ac.kr/wordpress/index.php/professor-jo-sungho/) and co-advised by Prof. [Soohwan Song](https://sites.google.com/view/smrlab/professor). Before joining KAIST, I did my Bachelor at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam. During this time, I worked on some projects related to topic modeling, machine learning.

**Research interests:** Currently, I have focused on addressing challenging problems in 3D reconstruction, which involves building a 3D model of a scene using monocular images. I have developed various advanced deep-learning models tailored to resolve several tasks in 3D reconstruction, including feature matching, visual localization, and multi- view depth estimation. Furthermore, I actively contribute research codes on [Github](https://github.com/TruongKhang), which are widely utilized by hundreds of users globally.

**I am looking for a new role. I am grateful for any advices and opportunities!**
